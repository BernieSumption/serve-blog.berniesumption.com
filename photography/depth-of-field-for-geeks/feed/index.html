		<description><![CDATA[Good article. But, I&#039;d should like to clarify one point. . .
When you speak of measuring blur in the real world, you are not really measuring in the real world, but are extrapolating the amount of blur you see in the image to how large that would be given the actual size of the subject or object being blurred in the image. Is that correct?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Good question. Depth of field is really a property that applies to optical systems and the images that they produce. Once you&#039;ve edited an image or combined several images together then all statements about depth of field no longer have their strict technical meanings. You could go by aesthetics and say &quot;This edited photo seems to have half the depth of field of the original&quot;, but that&#039;s a human judgement, not a technical statement.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey! nice article. I was wondering though, can the blur still be measured when you already used a software on the image? example, helicon focus. or adobe photoshop. how can you say that it has a greater depth of field than the image which is not edited? you can&#039;t just say it&#039;s clearer, too. is there any way to measure depth of field when a software has already edited it?]]></description>
