		<description><![CDATA[Bernie,

Again a great experience sharing. I must say that most articles I&#039;ve read about photography are not as clear as yours and don&#039;t go in the technical side of photography which give this extra clarity.

Thanks for your contribution to making photography well understood.
Can&#039;t wait for your next writing.]]></description>
