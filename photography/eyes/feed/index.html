		<description><![CDATA[Interesting project, especially as one gets little idea of gender from the eye itself. Nicely presented.



Couple of technical points (as you&#039;re sharing workflow): Looks like you&#039;re actually using the canon 70-300 DO lens (at least in the picture you show here). I&#039;ve found that it softens up quite a bit if you put filters on the front (even a simple UV). Might want to try extension tubes instead of the 500D for sharper results.



On the hiraloam sharpening (High radium, low amount) that you use for contrast enhancement - I find it&#039;s generally betetr to apply before the low radius sharpeing rather than after, can help reduce artefacts.



Nice job on the SoFoBoMo website, btw.]]></description>
