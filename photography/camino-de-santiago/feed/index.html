		<description><![CDATA[Hi Richard,

Oops, I lost your comment and didn&#039;t reply for ages. Here it is:

My workflow is very simple. No GPS equipment. I just took pictures during the day, then each evening I uploaded a picture to flickr and placed it in a google map manually, using the &quot;My Maps&quot; feature (On the flickr photo page, go to &quot;Embed&quot; then copy the HTML. Create a new pin in the Google Maps interface, set the text box mode to HTML and paste the photo HTML in).

Bernie     :o)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hey,
i started learning html at w3 schools from scratch and i found your better animation in 2008 and it looked like magic to me. 
just what i wanted to be able to, too.
On my lonely pelgrimage i learned to do the same in javascript but now I noticed 
jQuery which saves lots of work. 
I also learned the gimp that s nice too.
Now, I have a better understanding and want to have a closer look at your animation.
I still have some questions for you so please reply to me ;).

		<description><![CDATA[LIKE! Could you give me a short insight of how your workflow looks like?
I know how to convert my Garmin tracks to a KML file, do you insert pics and videos in GE and can export them at once as a KML to GMap, upload the files to a hoster like Picasa and add the links manually later on, please enlighten me :)

Geo big map is an awesome plugin, thanks!]]></description>
