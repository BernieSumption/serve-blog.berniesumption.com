		<description><![CDATA[A lot of people ask this question :o) There are a couple of reasons. Firstly, this project predates the iPad, and such technology wasn&#039;t available then. Only very recently have large, thin, capacitive touch screens become available. And they&#039;re very expensive, and fragile, and still not quite big enough for a 4 person restaurant table. Secondly, even if we did use a capacitive membrane in addition to an overhead projector to make a large robust touch screen, as you relax and eat at a table you touch the table with your skin all the time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Bernie,
a question, why did the table have a mouse pointer and NOT a full touch screen for dragging images and selections, while making the touch sensors to be responsive only to skin (to avoid issues with plates and other stuff could be placed on table).
so was there a specific reason you chose to use a small corner on the table as the moouse-kinda control?]]></description>
