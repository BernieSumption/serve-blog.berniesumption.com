		<description><![CDATA[Hi Bernie,

still not what I meant but another good point :)
I tried it and it works, @MixinBase can be omitted in extending classes.

What I meant though was I don&#039;t want to repeat &quot;implements Logging&quot; in each derived class. So I tried something else and it works like a charm:

Implemented getInterfaces() in MixinFactory.
&lt;pre lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
	public static List&lt;Class&gt; getInterfaces(final Class clazz) {
	    Class c = clazz;
	    List&lt;Class&gt; result = new ArrayList&lt;Class&gt;(Arrays.asList(c.getInterfaces()));
	    while (true) {
	        c = c.getSuperclass();
	        if (c == null) {
	            break;
	        }
	        result.addAll(Arrays.asList(c.getInterfaces()));
	    }
	    
	    return result;
	}
&lt;/pre&gt;

called it in line 90:
&lt;pre lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
    for (Class mixinType: getInterfaces(mixinBase)) {
        ....
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

This does the trick, the &quot;Logging&quot; interface need not be declared again in AnotherLoggingClass.

Cheers,
bno]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Aah, I see.

Casting my mind back to the implementation, I see no reason why this issue couldn&#039;t be solved by putting an @Inherited annotation in MixinBase.java. It&#039;s just that annotations aren&#039;t inherited by default, and I never thought about this use case.

That said, since I never tested with inheritance, I can&#039;t guarantee that there&#039;s no part of the system that would break if you just added the @Inherited annotation.

If you try it, let me know!

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Bernie,
thanks for your comments.
Sorry, misunderstanding.

I was talking about a class extending a class implementing a mixin.

Like so:

&lt;pre lang=&quot;JavaScript&quot;&gt;
@MixinType(implementation=LoggerMixIn.class)
public interface Logging {
    Logger getLogger();
}

@MixinBase
public abstract class LoggingClass implements Logging {
    public void doSomething() {
        getLogger().debug(&quot;Hello World!&quot;);
    }
}

@MixinBase
public abstract class AnotherLoggingClass extends LoggingClass {

    @Override
    public void doSomething() {
        getLogger().debug(&quot;Hello World from another one!&quot;);
    } 
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Code generation will fail unless AnotherLoggingClass also implements the Logging interface.

Is there another way to solve this?

Chers,
Bno]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[&gt; Inheritance only works when the class derived from a MixinBase again declares the MixinType interface.

Not true - I think you&#039;re confusing annotations and interfaces. In any case, the two classes don&#039;t extend each other, they are composed together.

&gt; And why is MixinSupport a singleton vs. utility class with static methods?

Good question. The reason was that MixinSupport declares an interface (MixinEngine if I recall correctly), so by making it an object, client code can accept any object of type MixinEngine and avoid tying themselves to a specific implementation of the mixin concept. That&#039;s a pretty unlikely use case, but it seemed like a good idea at the time :o)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi bernie,

I like. :)
Very easy to use, no config hassle, nicely done.

One thing though: Inheritance only works when the class derived from a MixinBase again declares the MixinType interface. Which is commonly accepted as bad practice.
It should be possible to detect MixinType interfaces in the type hierarchy... ?

And why is MixinSupport a singleton vs. utility class with static methods?

cheers,
Bno.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Michael, thanks for the comment.



I was able to step into the generated code in eclipse because I had set mixins4j to output code to a local folder, then set that folder as a source attachment when eclipse couldn&#039;t find the code the firs time I tried to step in. By default, all code is generated in memory, If I recall correctly there&#039;s a system property that sets a local folder to write files to. Search the source for uses of System.getProperty and you should find the property I used.



You&#039;re right, the @MixinBase could be optional. I made it required because I thought that if I didn&#039;t have a predictable marker on mixin base classes, then the only way of finding the mixins in your project would be to search for uses of MixinSupport (doesn&#039;t work if you instantiate the mixins through reflection, or if you haven&#039;t used a mixin class yet) or searching for classes that implement at least one interface that is annotated @MixinType (doesn&#039;t work if you use a different ImplementationSource that gets implementations from somewhere other than Java interfaces). It&#039;s a matter of taste really, rather than anything scientific.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Bernie,



I&#039;ve been looking at all the alternatives for mixins, and I like yours the best. It&#039;s friggin&#039; awesome!



A question and a suggestion follow.



Question: How did were you able to step into the generated code? I wasn&#039;t able to in eclipse.



Suggestion: I don&#039;t think you really need to have the MixinBase annotation _required_. You use it to get the mixer, but you can use a default for that.



Thanks for the awesome library,

Michael]]></description>
