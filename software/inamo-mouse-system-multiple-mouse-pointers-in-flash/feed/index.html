		<description><![CDATA[It actually works very well. Obviously there&#039;s a massive amount of custom coming from first-time visitors wanting to try the hot new thing, but there are a good number of regulars too, so it&#039;s obviously not just a novelty.

It&#039;s been a couple of years since I last went actually (the only downside of moving to Sydney)

On ROI I think there is something in the order of 10% greater profitability (don&#039;t quote me on that, the official figures are available somewhere on http://www.e-table-interactive.com). This comes from a combination of more efficient table usage (customers aren&#039;t hanging around waiting for service as much) and reduced staff expenses. However the big benefit is in the profile of the restaurant. Last time I checked, inamo is packed, 7 days a week, and won Time Out&#039;s &quot;Best Restaurant in London&quot; reader award. And that was the first restaurant opened up by the two founders who were twenty-something when they started the project. What are the odds of two restaurant newbies getting that result on their first attempt in one of the world&#039;s most competitive foodie cities?

And yes, there&#039;s a paper menu, just in case you want to take grandma :o)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting use of restaurant Tech. Curious about the guest reaction and user experience. Also, has this translated into any ROI for the restaurant? Has a sales increase followed the &quot;buzz&quot;? Is there a way for the guest to opt-out and use a paper menu instead? How has self ordering affected guest satisfaction and the inevitable &quot;I didn&#039;t order this&quot; question?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you Bernie for your prompt reply. I know people who uses 2 mouses on the same computer for many purposes. Can&#039;t they as well open an .SWF file and use the 2 mouses at the same time without having to add additional ActionScripts?]]></description>
