		<description><![CDATA[There&#039;s an interesting problem with the generative grammar and punctuation. The topmost clause explicitly adds full stops after each subpart. But some of the subparts can end with ! or ? which results in doubly punctuated endings like!.

It&#039;s tricky to fix though. I&#039;m not sure that the generative system described here can flexibly handle closing punctuation? It could be bodged in the Python, but that&#039;s a bit ugly.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[To be clear, I didn&#039;t post the Gulp file that the package.json replaced, but trust me it was hideous! If anything, syntax highlighting in Gulp files just serves to highlight all that unnecessary noise and implementation details, calls to .pipe(), functions etc. And this is just talking about readability - writability of Gulp files is even worse, for example getting calls to .pipe() in the wrong order will totally break things, so you need to understand what&#039;s going on under the hood. Command line interfaces are more of a black box, and generally you can mix arguments around and not break things.

So yes I&#039;d argue that the package.json was a big improvement, but you&#039;re right that it could be further improved. Embedding shell scripts in JSON isn&#039;t exactly pretty.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[A lot of people ask this question :o) There are a couple of reasons. Firstly, this project predates the iPad, and such technology wasn&#039;t available then. Only very recently have large, thin, capacitive touch screens become available. And they&#039;re very expensive, and fragile, and still not quite big enough for a 4 person restaurant table. Secondly, even if we did use a capacitive membrane in addition to an overhead projector to make a large robust touch screen, as you relax and eat at a table you touch the table with your skin all the time.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi Bernie,
a question, why did the table have a mouse pointer and NOT a full touch screen for dragging images and selections, while making the touch sensors to be responsive only to skin (to avoid issues with plates and other stuff could be placed on table).
so was there a specific reason you chose to use a small corner on the table as the moouse-kinda control?]]></description>

Edit &lt;code&gt;capture-image.sh&lt;/code&gt; and replace it with an alternative Linux shell command that captures an image from your camera and saves it to a file called &lt;code&gt;capture.jpg&lt;/code&gt;.

		<description><![CDATA[Love this!  Currently trying to implement it myself but a) my cats do not like the new catflap I brought and b) my USB webcam (a old ps3eyetoy) appears to have given up on life after years of being demoted to the loft.  

Any pointers for getting this to work with the rpi-cam which I have abundances of??]]></description>
